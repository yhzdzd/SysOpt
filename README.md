# SysOpt

SysOpt is an open-source Linux system and network performance optimization tool designed to help developers and system administrators quickly tune kernel parameters and optimize the network stack.  
The project is currently in the early development stage and will gradually submit code and documentation.  

---

## âœ¨ Project Goals
- Provide a one-click Linux kernel parameter optimization tool  
- Automatically apply optimal configurations for different workloads (web services, databases, container environments)  
- Offer network performance optimization (TCP/UDP tuning) to reduce latency and improve throughput  
- Support multiple architectures (x86_64 / ARM64) and various Linux distributions  
- Include performance benchmark tools for users to verify optimization results  

---

## ðŸ“… Development Progress
- Aug 2025: Project launched, planning and design completed  
- Sep 2025: Plan to submit the first prototype (basic kernel parameter optimization scripts)  
- Q4 2025: Add automated optimization strategies and performance testing modules  

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Approach
- Use Bash/Python scripts for optimization and configuration  
- Integrate common tools (sysctl, ethtool, perf, etc.)  
- Provide Docker images and installation packages for easy deployment  

---

## ðŸ“¢ Community Plan
- Developers are welcome to submit Issues and Pull Requests  
- Provide optimization examples and documentation for learning and practice  
- Open a demo environment in the future to showcase optimization effects  

---

## ðŸš€ Usage Example

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yhzdzd/sysopt.git
cd sysopt

2. Make scripts executable

chmod +x scripts/bench_network.sh
chmod +x scripts/optimize_sysctl.sh

3. Run baseline benchmark (before optimization)

./scripts/bench_network.sh

4. Apply optimization

sudo ./scripts/optimize_sysctl.sh

5. Run benchmark again (after optimization)

./scripts/bench_network.sh

By following this sequence, users can compare the network performance before and after applying the optimizations, including improvements in latency, download speed, and response time.
